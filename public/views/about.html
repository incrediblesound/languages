<h2>What is Languages?</h2>
<p>Languages is a platform that facilitates the recording of languages. This website is for people who want to invent their own language or store an existing one.</p>
<h2>Dictionary</h2>
<p>The dictionary stores the words of an individual language. Words only have two required properties: "word" and "definition". "Word" refers to the romanization of a word which will serve as the unique identifier for a functional meaning bearing unit in a language. "Definition" is an explanation in English of the meaning of that word. A word may also have classes, which correspond to parts of speech, and transformations, which are variations on a single word.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>Grammar stores the classes, which are parts of speech like "adjective", "verb", "number", and structures, which define the ways that classes can be put together into sentences and phrases.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Notes are short texts written in a given language that demonstrate usage and/or provide an outlet for creative expression and exploration. Notes are the only part of a language that can be written by anybody on the site. If someone writes a note in your language you will recieve a news item on your home page. You can then go to your notes and click "merge" which will make that note visible to everybody, you can delete the note if you don't like it, or you can edit it, which will also have the effect of merging it in.<p>
